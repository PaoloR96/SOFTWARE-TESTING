The "Testing Game" project primarily focused on testing two fundamental components of the application, with the goal of verifying their robustness and compliance with the specified requirements. Our testing approach was structured to ensure that these objectives were achieved with a high level of reliability.To this end, a modular, robust, and easily extendable test suite was designed and implemented. This suite was developed to ensure that the application met both functional and non-functional requirements. The adopted approach effectively covered the system's key functionalities by combining unit tests and integration tests.A total of 130 test cases were developed, achieving an average coverage of 80% to 90% for code instructions, branches, and functions.
This document provides a detailed description of the design and execution phases of the testing process, highlighting the results obtained and analyzing any issues encountered along the way.
